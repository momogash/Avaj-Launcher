while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
now we start to read simulation text each line until null is reached starting at index 1 skipping simulation count 25
each line read is to create a new aircraft from AircraftFactory class.

AircraftFactory class has a method of type Flyable called newAircraft which takes in a 
1) String(Type of aircraft to create, Baloon,JetPlane,etc),
2) String(name of the aircraft to create, B1, H1)
3) Int(longitude)
4) Int (latitude)
5) Int (height)t
The newAircraft method then checks if the type is a Baloon or Helicopter or JetPlane,
				 
The last 3 integers will be stored in an object of type Coordinates named coordinates, which will be used manipulates the aircraft's coordinates in the event of weather(Rain, Snow, Fog, Sun)
