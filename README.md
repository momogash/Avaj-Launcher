First project Java project @ WeThinkCode_
Project itself is to design a Simulation for different type of aircraft and their interaction with the weather. A UML diagram is provided with all the minimum classes and attributes needed to be implemented. After we had to account for a few rules which are:

Coordinates are positive numbers.
The height is in the 0-100 range.
If an aircraft needs to pass the upper limit height it remains at 100.
Each time an aircraft is created, it receives a unique ID. There can’t be 2 aircrafts with the same ID.
If an aircraft reaches height 0 or needs to go below it, the aircraft lands, unregisters from the weather tower and logs its current coordinates.
When a weather change occurs, each aircraft type needs to log a message, as seen in the example.  A funny message will be appreciated during the correction.
Each time an aircraft registers or unregisters to/from the weather tower, a message will be logged.
